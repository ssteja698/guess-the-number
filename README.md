# Guess the Number

* This project is about guessing the number.
* Based on the user inputs, the output is given in order to help him/her reach the actual number to be guessed.
* If the user guesses the answer correctly, the game is said to be finished.

### This project has two specialities:
* This takes in the speech input and checks if that number is equal to the actual number.
* This contains a custom designed (with just CSS) mic icon.
